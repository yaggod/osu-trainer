# osu-trainer
A program that allows you to modify the difficulty of a beatmap **very quickly and easily**.

### Additional Notes
+ Maps can be created without alt tabbing if you make good use of the profiles and hotkeys
+ Search "osutrainer" in osu! to find all your generated maps
+ If you use this application a lot, you can end up using a lot of disk space. (333 mp3s * 3MB/mp3 = 1GB). To free up this space, delete the generated maps in osu, then click the Clean Up button in osu trainer.

Special thanks to [Craftplacer](https://github.com/Craftplacer) for making the UI really nice and pretty
